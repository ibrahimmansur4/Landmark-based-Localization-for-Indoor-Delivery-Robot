# Landmark-Based Localization for Indoor Delivery Robot

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the final year project focused on developing a landmark-based localization system for an indoor delivery robot within the SEECS faculty block. The project leverages the Robot Operating System (ROS) and utilizes the ROSARIA packages for communication with the Pioneer P3-DX mobile robot. The project emphasizes the implementation of advanced control systems, including localization, mapping, obstacle avoidance, and visualization using Gazebo and RViz.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Develop a robust landmark-based localization system for the indoor delivery robot.
- Implement mapping capabilities to create a representation of the environment.
- Integrate obstacle avoidance mechanisms for safe navigation.
- Utilize ROS, ROSARIA packages, Gazebo, RViz, and C++ for software development.
- Evaluate the system's accuracy, reliability, and efficiency through real-world testing.

## Methodology

The project follows these key steps:

1. **System Setup:** Configure the Pioneer P3-DX robot and establish communication using ROSARIA packages.
2. **Landmark Deployment:** Install active or passive landmarks within the faculty block for robot localization.
3. **Localization Algorithm:** Implement triangulation algorithms to calculate the robot's position based on signals from multiple landmarks.
4. **Mapping:** Utilize sensor data to create a map of the environment using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques.
5. **Obstacle Avoidance:** Develop algorithms to detect and avoid obstacles using sensor inputs.
6. **Visualization:** Integrate Gazebo and RViz for real-time visualization of the robot's navigation and environment.
7. **Testing and Validation:** Conduct extensive testing in the real environment to assess the system's accuracy and performance.

## Software and Tools

The following software and tools are used in this project:

- **ROS:** A flexible and modular platform for robot software development.
- **ROSARIA Packages:** For communication with the Pioneer P3-DX robot.
- **Gazebo:** A simulation environment for testing robot behaviors and interactions.
