# Landmark-based-Localization-for-Indoor-Delivery-Robot

Indoor localization using beacons or landmarks find a large variety of applications. Mobile robots which have to work within same indoor environment for large period of times have to be equipped with landmark based localization systems. Examples are robots working in large warehouses, indoor shopping arenas, office spaces etc. The landmark based localization system uses active or passive landmarks installed in the environment that transmit signals which are received by the robots. Signals received from multiple landmarks help robots find their position using triangulation.  We plan on developing a localization system for SEECS faculty block. We can use the PIONEER P3-DX mobile robot that is already available in ROMI Lab for the purpose.
